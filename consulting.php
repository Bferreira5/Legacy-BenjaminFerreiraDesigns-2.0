						<h3>Redesign for growth.</h3>
						<p>Every now and then your website needs a refresh. there are many good reasons for a website redesign, whether it’s a rebranding, moving onto a new content Management System (cMS), the site is getting lackluster results or it looks like it was built in 1999 (eek). Eventually, there comes a time when you’ve gathered all the low-hanging fruit possible. that’s when you need a bigger change. Radical redesigns are a great way to transform your site into a beautiful new butterfly.</p>

						<h3>Make your code work for you.</h3>
						<p>Having a website alone isn’t the key to great results. Instead, it’s the ability turn your website into an inbound marketing machine. Your website has a hefty goal and it needs to wear many hats. A website needs to not just exist, it needs to perform. It needs to attract visitors, educate them and convince them to buy.</p>
